# The Design Automator

The script.js file contains the base code used to automate custom design orders for eCommerce company. The challenge with running a custom design marketplace shop is its scalability. The alternative would be to hire more VAs to manually create and compile the designs which would require time, and money. Hence, this script saved me 3x more money and time.
