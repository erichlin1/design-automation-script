# The Design Automator

The script.js file contains the base code for the design automation script - used to streamline custom design orders for my eCommerce company. The challenge with running a custom design marketplace shop is scalability. The alternative would be to hire more VAs to manually create and compile the designs which would require time, and money. This script helped me reduce time spent on creating custom orders and saved me money from hiring VAs.
